======

A Simple flat-file blog exercise built with plain(procedural) php, no funky frameworks, no fussy builds or installs. And, it comes with a super easy admin panel to edit, delete, create posts and upload images.

This project was built as an exercise in learning basic php programing, it might not be suitable for hard core production use, but it is a usable solution for a lightweight - single user blog.

##Install

- You will need PHP running on your server with htaccess and mod_rewrite engine ON capabilities.
- Upload files inside Pencil/ folder anywhere you want to install the blog on your server.
- Edit assets/config.php
- Enable public read+write permissions to "posts/" and "media/"  folders. (chmod 755 or 777)

##Built in functionality:

- SEO friendly url, dynamic page titles and meta descriptions, including Open Graph meta tags.
- Easy configurable site name, author, description/homepage text and copyright text.
- Lightweight WYSIWYG to edit and create new posts, a modified version of [Trumbowyg](http://alex-d.github.com/Trumbowyg).
- Pagination happens on client side built using [jPages](http://luis-almeida.github.com/jPages) jquery plugin.
- No database needed, posts are stored as html in .txt files.

##Things to remember:

- Not equiped for Latin or Cyrillic languages.
- Strict file naming (slug) - always add date first in Y-M-D format, no capitalized letters, dash(-) instead of spaces, when creating new post in admin interface.
- Basic image file upload, you can then insert images in your post using their URL(ex: media/mypic.jpg).
- Admin page not secure, you can use htaccess to password protect this file.
- Strictly Apache + htaccess and mod_rewrite engine on.
- Enable public read+write permissions to "posts/" and "media/"  folders. (chmod 755 or 777)

##Bugs:

- Fix file sort for same date files, it still outputs the files, but it orders them alphabetically. Probably not a big issue if you're not posting more than one article a day.
- Still testing...
